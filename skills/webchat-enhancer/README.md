## Features

🖱️ **Hover to Expand** — A slim tab stays hidden on the right edge of the screen. Slide your mouse near it and the panel smoothly slides out. Move your mouse away and it hides again. No clicks needed.

🎨 **Auto Theme Sync** — Automatically detects whether your WebChat is in Dark or Light mode and instantly switches the navigator to matching Lobster-inspired colors. No manual switching, no settings panel — it just works.

📜 **Chat Navigator** — Scans your entire conversation and generates a list of clickable message cards. Click any card to smoothly scroll and jump to that exact message.

🔄 **Auto-Updating** — Detects new messages automatically as they appear. The message list stays fresh without any action from you.

⚡ **Lightweight** — Pure vanilla JavaScript. No external dependencies. No settings or configuration needed.
